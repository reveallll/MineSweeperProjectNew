# MineSweeperProjectNew
 I have tried too many other ways to make the game but this one works.
 In main method ı know ı should'nt have write code here other than calling MineSweeper method but ı did some simple 2-3 line code because I knew that ı will not use them again so ı am not repeating myself in the code.
 Look of the game can look a bit odd especially when you progress in the game but this does not breaks the game you can clearly understand
 In empty indexes I left it with null.
